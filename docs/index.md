# About

After a lot of thinking, following the example of [@niqdev][niqdev], I've decided to create this project to collect all the useful information about what I like most: **programming**.

This is still a draft of what can be a useful source of inspiration for new and old developers, and I've chosen to release it under the [GNU General Public License v3.0][LICENSE], because I honestly consider it one of the most powerful resource to help the community, giving to each other the Freedom to improve and share the knowledge. 

For this very reason, **I invite you to give your free contribution to this collection of documents**. They will be always accessible and they will be Free/Libre.

## Why doing this?

Most of all because **writing good software is hard**, and doing it without organizing your knowledge and keeping track of what you find useful is the act of a *fool*. I love to think our brains in the same way as Conan Doyle originally described it:

> *“I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. **Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic**. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.”*
